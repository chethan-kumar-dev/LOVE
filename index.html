            </div>
        </div>
       
        <div>
            Love begins with our thoughts. We become what we think. Loving thoughts create loving experiences and loving relationships. Affirmations can change our beliefs and thoughts about ourselves and others. If we want to love someone, we need to consider their needs and desires. Thinking about your ideal partner will help recognize him or her when you meet.

                <h3>THE POWER OF RESPECT</h3>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div>
            You cannot love anyone or anything unless you first respect them. The first person you need to respect is yourself. To begin to gain self-respect ask yourself, "What do I respect about myself? " To gain respect for others, even those you may dislike, ask yourself, "What do I respect about them?"         </div>

                <h3>THE POWER OF GIVING</h3>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div>
            If you want to receive love, all you have to do is give it! The more love you give, the more you will receive. To love is to give of yourself, freely and unconditionally. Practice random acts of kindness. The secret formula of a happy, lifelong relationship is to always focus on what you can give instead of you can take.         </div>

                <h3>THE POWER OF FRIENDSHIP.</h3>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div>
            To find true love you must first find a true friend. To love someone completely you must love them for who they are not what they look like. Friendship is the soil through which love's seeds grow. If you want to bring love into a relationship, you must first bring friendship.         </div>

                <h3>THE POWER OF TOUCH</h3>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div>
            Touch is one of the most powerful expressions of love, breaking down barriers and bonding relationships. Touch changes our physical and emotional states and makes us more receptive to love.

                        <h3>The power of Letting go.  </h3>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    If you love something, let it be free. Even in a loving relationship, people need their space. If we want to learn to love, we must first learn to forgive and let go of past hurts and grievances. Love means letting go of our fears, prejudices, egos and conditions.

                        <div>
                            
                            To love someone is to communicate with them. Let the people you love know; that you love and appreciate them. Never be afraid to say, "I love you." Never let an opportunity pass to praise and acknowledge someone. Always leave someone you love with a loving word ... it could be the last time you see them.
                        </div>
                    </div>
</div>
<div class="imp">
    If couples focus on the more important things that do not take place in the bedroom, they can create a connection that deepens and strengthens their feelings for each other. For instance, a study in the Journal of Marriage and Family showed that couples who communicate and listen to each other have a more satisfying relationship, which tops the stuff that happens in bed.
